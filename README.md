# Depot Capacity Redux

**Depot Capacity Redux**
- Lets players scale how many vehicles each transport depot can maintain or spawn in *Cities: Skylines II*
— plus how many passengers each vehicle can carry.

---

## What it does

- Adds sliders in the mod’s **Options** panel.
- **Depot capacity:** Bus, Taxi, Tram, Train, Subway  
  (scales the maximum vehicles per depot)
- **Passenger capacity:** Bus, Taxi, Tram, Train, Subway, Ship, Ferry, Airplane  
  (scales how many passengers each vehicle can carry)
- Each slider ranges from **100% → 1000%** of vanilla.
- Changing a slider automatically re-applies the new capacities in the loaded city.

### Notes
- *Depot capacity* = maximum number of vehicles a single depot can maintain or spawn.
- *Passenger capacity* = maximum passengers each vehicle can carry.
- Capacities reset correctly when loading a different city or save.
