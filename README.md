# Dispatch Boss

Dispatch Boss lets you scale **fleet sizes** and **vehicle capacities** in *Cities: Skylines II*.

## Features

### Public Transit
- **Depot capacity** (max vehicles per depot): Bus, Taxi, Tram, Train, Subway
- **Passenger capacity** (seats per vehicle): Bus, Tram, Train, Subway, Ship, Ferry, Airplane
- Optional: **Expand Transit Line in-game slider limits** (can allow down to 1 vehicle on most routes; max is also higher than vanilla)

### Industry & Cargo
- **Delivery vehicle cargo capacity**: Semi Trucks, Delivery Vans, Raw Materials trucks, Motorbike delivery
- **Cargo station fleet** (harbor/train/airport): max active transporters
- **Extractor fleet**: max trucks for industrial extractors

### Parks & Roads
- **Park maintenance**: depot fleet size, work shift capacity, vehicle rate
- **Road maintenance**: depot fleet size, work shift capacity, repair rate (alpha)
- **Road wear speed** (alpha)

### Debug Tools (About tab)
- **Prefab Scan Report** (writes `ModsData/DispatchBoss/ScanReport-Prefabs.txt`)
- **Open log folder** / **open report folder**
- Optional verbose logging (disable for normal gameplay)

## Notes
- Avoid running multiple mods that change the same capacities/policies (they can override each other).
- Changes apply live; no restart needed.
- Safe to remove any time (use reset buttons if you want to return to vanilla first).
