# Depot Capacity Redux

**Depot Capacity Redux** lets you scale how many (maximum) vehicles a transport depot can spawn in *Cities: Skylines II*.

This is a cleaned-up, expanded version of the original **Depot Capacity Changer** (see below).  


## What it does

- Adds 5 sliders in the mod Options:
- Depot capacity: Bus, Taxi, Tram, Train, Subway, Ship, Ferry
- Passenger capacity: Bus, Taxi, Tram, Train, Subway, Ship, Ferry, Airplane
- Sliders: **100% → 1000%**
- Each slider is **100% → 1000%** of vanilla depot vehicle capacity.
- Change a slider → the game updates depot capacities once.

### Notes
- “Depot capacity” = max vehicles allowed per depot building.
- This is different from passenger capacity.


### Languages
- English (en-US)
- French (fr-FR)
- Spanish (es-ES)
- German (de-DE)
- 简体中文 (zh-HANS)
