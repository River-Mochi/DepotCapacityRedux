	<LongDescription>### Dispatch Boss
	
Scale **fleet sizes** and **vehicle capacities** in: all Public Transit, Industry, Cargo stations, and Parks/Roads Maintenance.
New: includes Transit Line Slider vehicle increases.

### What it does

- **Transit depots**: change max vehicles per depot (Bus, Tram, Train, Subway)
- **Passengers**: change seats per vehicle (Bus, Tram, Train, Subway, Ship, Ferry, Airplane)
- **Industry Deliveries**: scale cargo capacity for delivery vehicles (Semi trucks, Delivery vans, Motorbike delivery, Raw materials trucks)
- **Extractor + cargo fleet**: scale max fleet for extractor transport companies + cargo stations (harbor/train/airport cargo)
- **Parks + Roads**: maintenance fleet size / work shift / rate + road wear speed (alpha)
- **Road wear speed (alpha)**: scale how fast roads accumulate wear over time
- Optional: **expand Transit Line in-game vehicle slider limits** (min can reduce to only (1) vehicle on most routes; maximums are also increased)

### Notes 🚍🚋🚆✈️🚢
- **Sliders** adjust any time, no restart needed.
- Supports switching cities.
- Transit lines: expanded limits still follow the game’s **route cycle time** (travel time + stops); slider gets higher maximums, but still varies per line (due to game's formula).
- Depot capacity = maximum number of vehicles a single depot can maintain/spawn (does not scale extension buildings).
- Avoid other depot/passenger capacity mods to avoid conflicts (they override each other).
- No Harmony or Reflection; more compatible - less likely to break with game updates.
- Safe to remove any time (use Reset buttons to return to vanilla game default values).
