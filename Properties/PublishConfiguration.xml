	<LongDescription>### Dispatch Boss

### What it does

- **Depots**: change maximum vehicles per Depot (Bus, Taxi, Tram, Train, Subway)
- **Passengers**:  increase how many passengers each vehicle can carry (bus, tram, trains, subway, airplane, ship, ferry)
- **Sliders** adjust any time, no restart needed.
- Supports switching cities.

### Notes 🚍🚋🚆✈️🚢
- Depot capacity = maximum number of vehicles a single depot can maintain or spawn (scales off base building, not extensions).
- Passenger capacity = maximum passengers each vehicle can carry.
- Remove other depot/passenger capacity mods to avoid conflicts (they override each other).
- Does not use Harmony or Reflection; more compatible - less likely to break with game updates.
- Safe to remove any time. Use reset all button to run as vanilla game default.

* added Industry Tab: includes Semi-Trucks, Delivery Vans, Motorbike Delivery, Raw Materials dump trucks (oil, coal, ore, stone),
* added Road Maintenance and Park Maintenance controls
* added feature to expand the Transit Line in-game slider from 1 to higher maximums (many more vehicles than vanilla allows).
* Rename to 'Dispatch Boss' because many new features are not just Public Transit.
