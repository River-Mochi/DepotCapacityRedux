	<LongDescription>### Dispatch Boss
	
Scale **fleet sizes** and **vehicle capacities** in: all Public Transit, Industry, Cargo stations, and Parks/Roads Maintenance.
New: includes Transit Line Slider vehicle increases.

### What it does

NEW **expand Transit Line in-game slider limits** (min can reduce to just (1) vehicle on most routes; maximums are all increased)
- **Transit depots**: change max vehicles per depot (Bus, Tram, Train, Subway)
- **Passengers**: change seats per vehicle (Bus, Tram, Train, Subway, Ship, Ferry, Airplane)
-NEW **Industry Deliveries**: scale cargo capacity for delivery vehicles (Semi trucks, Delivery vans, Motorbike delivery, Raw materials trucks - coal, oil, etc.)
-NEW **Extractor companies**: Fish, Grain, etc.; scale max fleet size (usually semi trucks)
-NEW **Cargo Stations**: scale max fleet of cargo stations (harbor/train/airport)
-NEW **Parks + Roads maintenance**: fleet size, work shift, rate (alpha)
-NEW **Road wear speed** (alpha): scale how fast or slow roads accumulate wear over time


### Notes 🚍🚋🚆✈️🚢
- **Adjust Sliders** at any time, no restart needed; Supports switching cities.
- New Transit lines: expanded limits still follow the game’s **route cycle time** (travel time + stops); slider gets higher maximums. It varies per line (due to game's formula).
- Depot capacity = maximum number of vehicles a single depot can maintain/spawn (does not scale extension buildings).
- **Avoid** other depot/passenger capacity mods to avoid conflicts (they override each other).
- No Harmony or Reflection; more compatible - less likely to break with game updates.
- Safe to remove any time (use Reset buttons to return to vanilla game default values).
