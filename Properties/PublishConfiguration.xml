	<LongDescription>### Dispatch Boss

Adjust vehicle capacities and building fleet limits across **Transit**, **Industry**, and **Maintenance** — plus an optional toggle to expand the vanilla **transit line vehicle slider**.

### What it does
- **Depots**: scale max vehicles per depot (Bus, Taxi, Tram, Train, Subway)
- **Passengers**: scale seats per vehicle
- **Industry Deliveries**: scale cargo capacity for delivery vehicles (Semi trucks, Delivery vans, Motorbike delivery, Raw materials trucks)
- **Extractor + cargo fleet**: scale max fleet for extractor transport companies + cargo stations (harbor/train/airport cargo)
- **Road + Park maintenance**: scale depot fleet size, work capacity, and work rate
- **Road wear speed (alpha)**: scale how fast roads accumulate wear over time
- **Transit line slider limits**: allows game's route line slider to reach **1 vehicle** on most routes and higher maximum vehicles.


### Notes 🚍🚋🚆✈️🚢
- **Sliders** adjust any time, no restart needed.
- Supports switching cities.
- Transit lines: expanded limits still follow the game’s **route cycle time** (travel time + stops); slider gets higher maximums, but still varies per line (due to game's formula).
- Depot capacity = maximum number of vehicles a single depot can maintain or spawn (scales off base building, not extensions).
- Remove other depot/passenger capacity mods to avoid conflicts (they override each other).
- No Harmony patching; more compatible - less likely to break with game updates.
- Safe to remove any time (use Reset buttons to return to vanilla values).
